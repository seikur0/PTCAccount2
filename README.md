# Pokemon Trainer Club Account Creator 2
Script heavily based on the original [PTCAccount](https://github.com/jepayne1138/PTCAccount), by [jepayne1138](https://github.com/jepayne1138).

## Description
Semi-automatic creation of PTC accounts, with manual user intervention required for CAPTCHA input. This script is built on Selenium, which utilises a browser for automation rather than pure HTTP requests.

## Installation

This script runs on Selenium using ChromeDriver. See the [Google documentation](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for platform specific installation.

OSX Installation: `brew install chromedriver`

Once ChromeDriver is installed, install PTCAccount2 from Github using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/Kitryn/PTCAccount2.git`

NOTE: Google Chrome (the browser) must be installed for this script to work!

## Use

### Command line interface:

After installing the package run 'ptc2' from the terminal to create a new account. Optional parameters include --username, --password, and --email. Use --help for more commands and command line interface help.

Example 1 (Create entirely random new account):

```
> ptc2
Account successfully created.
  Username:  BcZvTnlTMwHsa6v
  Password:  WgZApVU5edTBMCs
  Email   :  ZApVgwHsa6sv@5aDsy.com
```

Example 2 (Create a new account with specified parameters):

```
> ptc2 --username=foo --password=bar --email=shin@ramyun.com
Account successfully created.
  Username:  foo
  Password:  bar
  Email   :  shin@ramyun.com
```

Example 3 (Create multiple accounts with a Gmail account for verification):
```
> ptc2 --email=len@gmail.com --multiple=2 --tofile
Creating new account(s):
...
...
...
Appended to file accounts.txt
Summary of accounts created:
3Dt9louj4X1cgA8:8NiCxnMKw6SC0UF
jTd5IrV5kDkzG9l:zyoqLOCoATdLImO
```

Extra options:

* `--multiple=MULTIPLE`: Specify number of accounts to make. `--username` cannot be set while `--multiple` is greater than 1.
* `--birthday=BIRTHDAY`: Specify a birthday. Must be between 1910 and 2002. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* `--compact`: Compact the output to "username:password"
* `--tofile` : Append newly created username and password into file "accounts.txt" with format "username:password".
* `--email-tag`: If set, adds the username as a tag to the email (i.e addr+tag@mail.com). Automatically set if --multiple is >1, AND an email is provided.

Note: email tags may not work with all service providers. Only tested with Gmail.

**As package:**

import the _ptcaccount2_ package to create new accounts in your own scripts:

```python
>>> import ptcaccount2
>>> ptcaccount2.random_account()
{"username": "BcZvTnlTMwHsa6v", "password": "WgZApVU5edTBMCs", "email": "ZApVgwHsa6sv@5aDsy.com"}
```

**Specifying your own data:**
```python
>>> ptcaccount2.random_account(
            username=<your data>,
            password=<your data>,
            email=<your data>,
            birthday=<your data>,
            email_tag=<True/False>,
            captcha_handler=_default_captcha_handler):
        ...
        ...
        ...
```

Note: `birthday` must be a string in YYYY-MM-DD format.

`captcha_handler` is a function that allows you to specify your own custom handler. It is called when the script reaches the CAPTCHA portion of the webpage.

The behaviour of _default_captcha_handler is to simply wait for the user the handle the CAPTCHA input. Users can replace this with their own function that, for example, calls an external API to solve the CAPTCHA for them.

`captcha_handler` takes a single argument: the Selenium WebDriver. It should also return a boolean, indicating whether the CAPTCHA was a success, or a failure (e.g. timeout).



## Troubleshooting

### OSX installation

Some OSX users may run into an issue which points to an error occurring in line: `create_account driver = webdriver.Chrome()` This may be related to `brew install chromedriver` installing a 32bit version rather than 64bit version.

To fix, see [this issue](https://github.com/Kitryn/PTCAccount2/issues/1) to make brew install the 64bit version of ChromeDriver.
